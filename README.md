# Memseg-Implementation
Unofficial individual re-implementation for [MemSeg: A semi-supervised method for image surface defect detection using differences and commonalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00908)

Actually this is my first time to do re-implementation work, a few details are still not clear during work, very grateful for all the criticism
